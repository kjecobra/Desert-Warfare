# 🏜️ DESERT WARFARE - A Fallout 4 Overhaul  
### *A Ruthless Wasteland Reimagined*

> **The Commonwealth is gone.**  
> Once green and full of life, it’s now a sun-scorched wasteland of dust, ruin, and blood. Raiders, mutants, synths, gunners, and worse roam the open desert, smarter and more aggressive than ever. **Death comes quickly here.**

**Will you survive long enough to build something new—or be buried in the sand like those before you?**

---

## 🌍 Overview

Once a world of color and life, the Commonwealth has become a scorched, windblown desert. The sun blazes overhead, drying the earth into cracked soil and turning lush forests into dusty plains. Vegetation is sparse. The only things that grow now are **desperation, decay—and danger**.

The sands echo with gunfire, distant explosions, and the howling winds that carry the cries of the dead. **Everything** in this world is trying to kill you.

From mutated horrors to ruthless raider warbands, cybernetic Gunners to cunning Synth squads, this is no longer a fight for survival—**this is war**.

Enemies are faster, smarter, deadlier. **AI overhauls** and new **faction behavior scripts** ensure they flank, ambush, and hunt you with brutal precision. Even settlements aren't safe—you’ll build and defend them using **Sim Settlements 2 & 3**, but expect raids, betrayals, and desperate last stands.

> Your only hope? **Allies. Gear. And your will to survive.**
